**Abstract:**

One of the most obvious impacts of the aviation industry is noise produced from the traffic going in and out of airports. The aircraft noise generated from the aircraft engine and frame is most evident in landing and taking off, and even when the aircraft is taxiing. With such environmental effect on aircrafts, people who live near airports can suffer from mental and emotional problems such as loss of concentration and cardiovascular effects especially when exposure is prolonged. The goal of this project is to create a webmap application that can visualize the noise pollution created by airplanes around Salzburg and at Salzburg airport. In addition, we would like to see the average noise pollution every month and visualize real time Salzburg Airport noise. To portray the range of noise pollution to  affected demographics, we will add layers of some of the establishments in Salzburg City. Users can estimate the noise impact with regards to their distance from the airport. Data will be sourced from Opensky, Open Government Data Salzburg, Salzburg Airport Noise and use Postgresql as the database platform. While having a busy airport can be a sign of progress, it is important for government, stakeholders and policymakers to strategize on how to improve regulations in future urban planning such as construction of public facilities (e.g. hospital, schools or parks) that can affect a great portion of the society especially the vulnerable (e.g. elderly, sick, kids, pregnant women).
